when connection is connected client sends user id,every other time client sends if he is still alive every 2 sec and sets flag "alive" to true

//if addr is in queue then hold user in queue, if not delete

if queue doesnt contain address add it to queue
go func that sleep for 2,5 sec if flag "alive" is true sets it to false, otherwise delete address from queue
